# JavaScript Coding Style Guide
## Indents
- Indent type: 2 Spaces (I was intending Tabs before, but wechat doesn't offer this setting)
## Spaces
- After inline commas(,)
- After semicolons(;) in for statements
- Before and after binary operators
- Before left braces({) if there are keywords before them
- Before and after `=>` in arrow functions
## Newlines
- Keep left braces({) in the same line with their keywords
- Keep `} else {` in the same line
- As long as there are more than one members in braces, the members must be in a seperate new line
## Naming
- Functions: start with a lowercase letter, other words starts with uppercase letters
- Classes: All words starts with uppercase letters
- (global / property) Variables: all letters lowercase, seperate with underline(_)
- (local / argument) Variables: start with a lowerline(_), all letters lowercase, seperate with underline(_)
